## My .vimrc configuration

### How to use this file
- I use (vim-plug)[https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug] as my vim plug in manager, you 
are more than welcome to use your own but I find this one to be quite easy to 
maintain. Make sure you follow the instructions on how to set up vim-plug before
actaully using this file. 
- I use neovim, it is more extensible than vim and I find it a bit easier to find
  support for plug ins with neovim than with regular vim. This *technically* works with
  vim. 
- I changed aliases to for vim, you don't have to do this but I'm lazy and did not want
  to type nvim every single time.
- After you have installed vim plug all you have to do is open with vim `.vimrc` and run
  `:PlugInstall` all of the plugins should be installed and you can see if it worked on
  the left side of your screen.
